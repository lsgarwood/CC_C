/* Float and Double
A float has less precision than a double, 6 vs 15 possible decimal places respectively, and therefore takes up less memory (4 vs 8 bytes). 
However, a double run faster, so you gain speed at the cost of more memory usage

Two places to set a variables value
set at declaration

/*
Constants
Any basic data type in C, like those we have gone over, can be declared as a constant using the keyword const before the type. So instead of our template of type variable_name, it would be const type variable_name.

It is also a best practice to use all upper case letters when declaring a constant:

Casting types
YOU COULD NOT DO THIS 
int a;
double b = 3.0;
a = b;
There are two types of conversions, implicit and explicit
Our example above was implicit, the compiler in this case will make a best guess.
The other way to convert a variable from another type is explicitly. You can do this by simply telling the compiler what type you want to set it to. So in our example above we could change the line a = b to a = (int)b. 
That way if b was something other than 3.0, such as 3.2, we are telling the compiler to make it work, so it would set it to 3
